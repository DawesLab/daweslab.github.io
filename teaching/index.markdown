## Teaching Philosophy


I strive to maintain an engaging classroom setting and support my students in their efforts to understand and improve our world. As part of my teaching mission, I am also interested in developing simple demonstrations of quantum mechanics, nonlinear optics, and other interesting physical phenomena that have been previously inaccessible to undergraduate students. The range of learning experiences found in undergraduate laboratories can be easily extended as optical and experimental equipment costs are reduced through the development of new technologies. Furthermore, a combination of creativity and inspiration can result in very insightful teaching labs without the budgets that have historically set large research institutions above smaller college settings in terms of providing advanced laboratory education. To this end, I seek to apply my skills in optics and teaching to the development of laboratory experiences that bring cutting edge research to the undergraduate classroom.
