<p>There are probably only a dozen people this post applies to, but in the interest of helping them out, I've documented the steps we took to make our Princeton Instruments camera work under Fedora 19.</p>
<p>Create a file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/pleora.conf with:</p>
<p>/opt/pleora/ebus_sdk/lib<br />/opt/pleora/ebus_sdk/lib/genicam/bin/Linux64_x64</p>
<p>This lets ldconfig know where to look for shared libraries.</p>
<p>The user running the code needs to source /opt/PrincetonInstruments/picam/set_picam_env either by hand or in their .bashrc file</p>
<p>Run commands with sudo:</p>
