<p>In a post responding to the <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/10/31/after-student-complaints-utah-professor-denied-job">firing of Stephen Maranville</a> at Utah, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blognetwork/castingoutnines/2011/11/02/was-this-professor-really-fired-for-being-too-tough/">Robert Talbert</a> makes an excellent point about good teaching that resonates with my philosophy.</p>
<blockquote><p>"good teaching is not the same as using interesting teaching techniques" - R. Talbert,Â <em>Casting Out Nines</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This has come up several times in discussions with peers and faculty at other institutions. Physics in particular has a wealth of research into the relationship between learning styles and teaching methods. Quantitative results suggest that lecture alone is not an effective way to teach physics.</p>
