<p>An exciting turn of events has transpired this year, starting almost exactly on the first of the year. Long story short, I will be starting a position as a Senior Software Engineer at Apple in June. Many of you know that I was recently awarded tenure at Pacific University and I am not particularly keen on the idea of walking away from the fruits of my labor here. However, the opportunities and experiences I will have at Apple are worth the change. I have been granted a one-year leave of absence in order to keep tenure (and my position at Pacific) if the move isn't a good fit. It will be a grand adventure for the whole family and I anticipate some bumps in the road. I am very excited to join a thriving company with many interesting projects on their horizon. The Bay Area will be very different from Forest Grove, but we hope to find similar comforts and will</p>
