<p>What happens when a pulse of light first hits a gas of atoms? The short answer is: nothing! In the first 20 nanoseconds or so the pulse of light is actually transmitted; the first 1-2 ns is 100% transmitted. After that, the atoms Â start to realize what is hitting them and absorption kicks in. The graph below shows the intensity (brightness) of the light as a pulse of light is transmitted through a cloud of atoms.</p>
