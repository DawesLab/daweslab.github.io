<p>Ever get tired of tracking twenty slightly different files with ever-growing names like Proposal_draft_withComments_AMD_changes_by_DSD.docx? There are many solutions to this phenomenon, and while one of them is very easy to use (word comments and track changes) it still seems under-utilized. Furthermore, word, despite being available to most computer users, is not universally available. This may or may not be your personal priority, but walking away from word was a very liberating step for me as I keep track of my teaching documents (syllabi, assignments etc.). The other reason to step away from word (and toward a plain text format) is the possibility of using version control for all of your files.</p>
<p><strong>Version Control means Git</strong></p>
<p>When I talk about version control, I really mean git, and while there are others, git is what you want to learn if you don't know version control yet. Git is free open-source software that you can download and install to any computer you work on. The easiest place to start with git is to create an account with GitHub which is an online service provider that can also host your version-controlled <em>repository</em> (i.e. your stash of files). GitHub offers a desktop application that connects to their server and helps you manage repositories on your own computer as well as helping you keep your files in sync with public repos on their servers.</p>
