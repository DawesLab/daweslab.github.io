<p>Our short article on the Quantum state tomography of slow and stored light is now available from the SPIE Proceedings site. This is the work I would have presented at Photonics West had I not been violently sick with the norovirus for that day of the conference. I have posted the slides of the talk at my website and am happy to answer questions if anyone was hoping to see it presented.</p>
