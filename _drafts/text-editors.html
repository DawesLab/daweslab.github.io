<p>It seems like text editors are suddenly the hot new tool... which is a good thing if you agree that learning to code is a central skill in the modern world. One result of this newfound hotness is the availability of many new and fancy editors. I've played with TextMate, the first of the new mainstream editors, and SublimeText, the one that dethroned TextMate. Now that both of those products have finished their boom-time dev cycle: the developers are awesome and get way too busy to keep up with their own amazing products and get swept up in other work. The downside is that both TM and SublimeText were closed-source but highly community-supported, with plugins and other nice add-ons. Now there is a void, people want their cake and to eat the plugin too. Thus come a few other editors like Lime and Atom. I've played with Atom for a few days and have now started using it for about 90% of my text editing work.</p>
