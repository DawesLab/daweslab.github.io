<p style="padding-left:30px;">
<p>Many people first met Seth by doing something wrong to their computer in grad school. He ran the physics network so smoothly that he would know within minutes if your desktop shut down or rebooted. In 2002 there was a major ice storm and we camped out in the department. A small space heater tripped a breaker and he came up in about two minutes to see why four machines and a printer fell off the network. After a deserved scolding for overloading the socket, he counted out the amps each computer drew and pointed out how we should have known that the heater would trip the 20 amp breaker. That lesson has served me at least as well as everything else I learned in grad school. Seth will be missed, and Eunice is in our thoughts.</p>
