<p>I was at the PNACP conference last weekend where the theme was Outreach. It really got me in gear to start some collaborations around the region for getting into elementary classrooms for some demo shows and hands-on science with kids. My parents were actually invited presenters at the conference. They presented a talk on their work with the Palouse Discovery Science Center in Pullman WA. Aside from their talk, I was quite impressed with a variety of efforts underway around the Northwest.</p>
