<p>A recent post by Rhett Allain at DotPhysics on <a href="http://ajp.aapt.org/resource/1/ajpias/v75/i7/p583_s1?isAuthorized=no">Slinky Physics</a> reminded me of a project I started playing with a few months ago. I love the falling slinky demo for a variety of reasons and his analysis and discussion is a great addition to the phenomena. What I started to explore is how the end of the slinky moves if you start with a hanging slinky and suddenly gather or drop extra loops. In essence, this is sending a compression (or rarefaction) pulse down the slinky. I observed that the resulting motion of the hanging end is very much like a square wave. The end will drop, hover about the lower point while several pulses travel up and down, and then the end will rise to a new resting point while several additional pulses travel the length of the slinky.</p>
<p>This phenomena is shown in the following video. Why is this interesting? Recall from Fourier theory that a square wave can be created by summing the proper ratios of a set of sine wave harmonics. The square wave traced out by the slinky end, can be considered the result of the sum of the motion of a large set of slinky modes, just like the square wave is the result of the sum of a set of sine wave modes.</p>
<p>With the slinky, you can observe that some modes are cutoff because the square wave is not perfect, there is some overshoot and "settling" as the motion goes on. This motion contains information about the slinky and how those modes propagate.</p>
