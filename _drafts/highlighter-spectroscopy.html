<p>Why is that highlighter so bright? Probably because you are used to seeing your markers absorb colors instead of emit them. To be clear, we need to talk about how visible colors work. Each color has a specific wavelength and frequency (like the pitch of a musical note). We see red as a different color from blue because red has a longer wavelength than blue, all of the colors between red and blue are called the visible <em>spectrum</em>. The color of an object is determined by the color of the light that makes it from that object to our eyes. In particular, a red object looks red because it either emits red light (like a red LED or the red parts of your computer screen) or because it absorbs all the other colors (so only red is left when the light reflects).</p>
<p>There is also another process that plays a role in the color of a highlighter: fluorescence. Fluorescence happens when a material absorbs one color of light (one wavelength) and emits a different color of light. This may not sound like it is related to fluorescent lights, but in fact it is. Fluorescent lights have a white coating on the inner surface of the bulb that absorbs some wavelengths and emits others. This makes them look more natural than the colors that would otherwise be emitted by mercury vapor.</p>
<p>What about markers? As I said, fluorescence is happening in highlighters, but we can't always tell unless we look at the light more carefully. In particular, we'd like to know how much of each color is reaching our eye. In order to do this, we'll use a spectrum—meter or "spectrometer."  The one I have is easily attached to a Vernier LabQuest 2 which will measure the amount of each wavelength of light entering the spectrometer.</p>
<p>We have two experiments to do: First we will look at the spectrum of a few different light sources. Then we'll look at the colors that would reach our eye when we shine those light sources on different colored squares (each square was drawn using a different marker).</p>
