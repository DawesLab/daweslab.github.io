These pages represent the work of Andrew M.C. Dawes and students working in his research lab at [Pacific University](http://pacificu.edu). Initial content comes from posts on his blog [The Daily Photon](http://dawes.wordpress.com) but going forward the content here will be more specific to the work of the Dawes Lab.

This site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com).
