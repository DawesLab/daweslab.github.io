*Q-function figure (without labels) as presented in PRA Kaleidoscope.*

This figure, generated from our data and visualized using matplotlib, was selected to be featured in [PRA's Kaleidoscope listings](https://journals.aps.org/pra/kaleidoscope/pra/90/5/053818). Figures are selected for aesthetics so we are naturally pleased to have this recognition.

For more on how this figure was created, see my earlier post on [publication-ready 3D figures from Matplotlib](https://dawes.wordpress.com/2014/06/27/publication-ready-3d-figures-from-matplotlib/). Finally, the source for this figure is available as an Ipython notebook in our [github repository](https://github.com/DawesLab/CCDimage/blob/master/Q%20function%20graphs%20for%20paper.ipynb):
