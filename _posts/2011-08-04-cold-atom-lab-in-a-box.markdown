I was quoted in a recent Photonics Spectra article "[Cold-Atom Lab in a Box](http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=47622)". The article describes the new Rubidium miniMOT available from ColdQuanta. My Photonics and Quantum Optics Lab at Pacific University was among their first customers. We've really enjoyed being involved with the early stages of this product and look forward to contributing to MOT research at the undergraduate (and perhaps high school) level.

For pictures of our trap in operation, see my earlier post "[MOT!](http://dawes.wordpress.com/2010/06/15/mot/)". We have done a variety of experiments and have trapped atoms in several different geometries since then. More details are described in the talk given by Simone Carpenter at the Northwest APS section meeting: [Off-the-shelf atom trapping [PDF]](http://newton.ns.pacificu.edu/~dawes/files/NWAPS2010.pdf)Â and the corresponding poster [Off-the-shelf atom trapping](http://commons.pacificu.edu/pu2rc/posters/student1/13/).

Please feel free to [contact](http://dawes.wordpress.com/dr_dawes/) me with any questions.
