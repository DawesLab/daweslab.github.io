<p>It's official. I successfully defended my dissertation today. The process was surprisingly enjoyable. After very little sleep, I still managed to give a good presentation and field a bunch of good questions. My committee was genuinely interested in my work and gave me lots of new ideas on where I can take the research.
<p>I have some corrections to make in my thesis, but otherwise I can relax a little bit. I'm glad I'll have a chance to write up some of my newest results and maybe get another paper out. That should make the transition to a new career at Pacific a little more productive. I'll post once my thesis is finalized and available online.</p>
