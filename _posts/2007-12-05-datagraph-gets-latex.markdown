![datagraph-icon](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/datagraph-icon.png)In a [previous post](http://dawes.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/mac-apps-round-1/), I listed DataGraph as one of my most-used mac apps. Its status as most-used just got a major boost with the addition of LaTeX functionality in the text label fields. To see this feature it action, you'll have to download the latest beta from the [DataGraph website](http://www.visualdatatools.com/DataGraph/index.html). I've posted some screenshots below the fold.
