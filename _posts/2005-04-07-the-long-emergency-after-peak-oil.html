<p>I don't know what's more surprising, that there is finally a description of how serious this problem is, or that there isn't a voice of opposition to be found. No screaming conservatives telling us it will all be fine, "just go buy another SUV and forget about it."</p>
<p>My question to the white house is: what good will a social security personal account do me if the country faces this kind of economic turmoil. It's a course we've been on for a while but with gay people getting married, feeding tubes getting removed, and Bush finding out there's no <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30794-2005Apr6.html">"pile" of social security money</a>, how could we possibly worry about something that actually effects the nation.</p>
<p>Unless some things change in the next ten years, we may be hearing a lot of "check this out... I saw this on survivor once."</p>
