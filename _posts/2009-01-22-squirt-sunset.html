<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/squirt_logo.jpg" alt="squirt_logo" title="squirt_logo" width="100" height="88" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-182" />Last semester, in Waves and Optics, we discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">Rayleigh</a> scattering. I described some simple examples, including the famous blue sky, and orange sunset. Earlier in the semester, I had coincidentally noticed that Squirt soda in a clear glass tends to be a little blue in hue, and not surprisingly, looks orange if held in front of a white light. So it turns out that in addition to milk drops in water, Squirt soda also exhibits this effect.
<p>Later in the semester, one of the students brought in a bottle of squirt to test my suggestion and did the demo for the whole class. After a little tinkering, it works best cut in half with water. This is for a large glass, so if you want to use a fishbowl or tank, you may have to dilute it even further.</p>
