I have finally reunited my 1988 IBM model M keyboard with my primary computer. Currently, my desktop is an 8-core mac pro. I'm sure the keyboard has never had so much power at its disposal. It took some [adapting](http://www.clickykeyboards.com/index.cfm/fa/items.main/parentcat/11298/subcatid/0/id/124184), and key re-mapping, but I'm typing this post to the classic cadence of buckling springs. "It's so choice, if you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up."

<!-- more -->For anyone that is interested, the basic key re-mapping can be done in the mac system preferences. Under "Keyboard" there is a "Modifier Keys..." button that allows you to reassign the control, command, option, and caps lock keys. I've set up the following map:

Caps Lock key is "control"

Alt key is "command"

Control key is "option"

Command key is "caps lock"

Note: since the IBM Model M does not have a command key I've effectively thrown out "caps lock." But honestly, aside from [email screamers](http://email.about.com/od/netiquettetips/qt/Writing-In-All-Caps-Is-Like-Shouting.htm), who uses caps lock?

I have also downloaded [DoubleCommand](http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/) which offers more powerful key re-mapping. If it is dramatically better, I'll post a note about it here.
