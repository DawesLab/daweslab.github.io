<p>I was recently invited to contribute an opinion on a paper by Stefan Schumacher et al. that extends some of my research on pattern-based all-optical switches to semiconductor systems. The paper appears in the January issue of Physica Status Solidi and should be available online now.</p>
<p>Download a PDF copy: A.M.C. Dawes, <a href="http://newton.ns.pacificu.edu/~dawes/files/pssr.200950106.pdf">Towards a single-photon all-optical transistor</a>, Phys. Status Solidi 3, A17-A19 (2009).</p>
<p>You may also notice this link will take you to my new website for the <a href="http://newton.ns.pacificu.edu/~dawes">Photonics and Quantum Optics lab</a> at Pacific.</p>
