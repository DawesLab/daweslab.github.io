The miniMOT system arrived in the lab last week and today we have successfully trapped our first cloud of atoms. The picture above shows a glowing ball of atoms that is roughly 5 mm in diameter. In the next few days we will characterize and optimize our atom trap. Stay tuned for density and temperature information.
