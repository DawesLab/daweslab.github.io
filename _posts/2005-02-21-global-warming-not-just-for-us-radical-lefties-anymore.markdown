[Times Online - World](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1489955,00.html): "'The debate about whether there is a global warming signal now is over, at least for rational people,'"

I don't mean to be on a tear about global warming (it's no shock to me) but as long as people are finally paying attention, I'll do my part to keep it on the radar.

Now if only we had some rational people around to run the country...
