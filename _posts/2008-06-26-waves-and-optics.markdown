It's been a little while since CLEO and my last post. Things have been hectic to say the least. The past few weeks included:


	
  * a trip to Forest Grove to look for houses

	
  * a week at home with Carter (17 mo. old) while Leslie went to Volleyball tournament

	
  * showing our house twice

	
  * receiving two offers on our house

	
  * signing one of them






We've had the home inspection and are waiting on the "Requested Repairs" paperwork, otherwise things are looking good.




"What does this have to do with Waves and Optics?" you ask. Well that is the course that I am responsible for this fall. I'm also teaching Geometrical Optics I and Workshop Physics (calc-based intro) but those courses are already put together.

Waves and Optics with Prof. Dawes (aka PHY 332)... what will it be, what wonders of physics will be explored and experienced by students in my class? I am leaning towards using H. J. Pain's "The Physics of Vibrations and Waves" which starts with simple harmonic motion, builds on the wave equation from SHM, and then branches out to sound, water, and EM waves. The latter parts of the book are primarily optics: diffraction, interference, scattering etc. I really want to work in some current research results, especially since things like slow- and fast-light naturally come out of a discussion of wave physics. Another neat topic in the news lately are negative-index metamaterials. Of course there are also my own research interests: pattern formation, and nonlinear optics.




I don't think I'll have trouble coming up with current material, but I'm happy to hear other suggestions on recent topics that would fit into a course on waves and optics. I'm sure there are plenty that I'm not thinking of at the moment. Especially welcome are suggestions from any of you experts outside my subfield of optics.
