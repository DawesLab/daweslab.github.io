What started as a pretty informal online chat about an old riddle has led to several risky video-experiments and an even shakier theoretical analysis.

It's also good for a peek at the ways theorists and experimentalists approach any given problem.[Juggling off the Weight](http://rulesoflunch.wordpress.com/2007/08/31/juggling-off-the-weight/)
