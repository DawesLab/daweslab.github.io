[Flip the Conference](http://cogdogblog.com/2012/03/08/flip-more-than-classrooms/)

A great idea inspired by flipped classrooms: Distribute videos (and slides perhaps) of talks accepted to conference, then invite everyone to physically meet and discuss them (or discuss whatever). This would be awesome, and I know many people who attend conferences simply to meet with peers. The talks are a place to catch up on sleep from the late night chats, brainstorms, and debates.
