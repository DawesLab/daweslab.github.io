<p>For such a great moment in physics, I wish the PR had been controlled as well as the beam. Quotes like <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/09/080910-collider-success.html">"Oh, wow, it actually worked!"</a> don't necessarily encourage government spending on 20-year-long half-billion-dollar research projects. There is enough skepticism working against science, I would have hoped for more confidence from the National Geographic press. On the other hand, I'm excited to learn more about the Higgs boson and see where things go in the high energy physics world. It should be a busy few years.</p>
