![Vernier](http://www.vernier.com/images/vernier_logo_black.png)I have been teaching with Vernier hardware for at least 10 years, so it is great to see them supporting work on the Arduino platform (another passion of mine). I'll keep an eye out for the Sparkfun boards this fall, this is a great way to get more sensors available for use in our electronics class projects.

They have a very nice guide to interfacing with their sensors:
