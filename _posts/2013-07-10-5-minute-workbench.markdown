I've had grand plans to build a custom workbench for my research lab, but other projects take up my time and kept it from happening. Then in a moment of desperation while trying to move a desk out of the lab, I realized it could complete our workbench. An aluminum rod for the spool holder and two angle brackets to hold it in place. Grand total, $7.49 and 5 minutes to move and build.
