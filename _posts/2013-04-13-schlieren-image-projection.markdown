I have been working on a [Schlieren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography) Imaging setup for demonstrations and discovered an easy way to project the image onto a viewing screen. For reference, the mirror I used is a 1.5 m focal length mirror, 6" diameter. Other parts are a simple LED flashlight and a 2 mm aperture.
