[![ArticleÂ Widget](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/science.png)](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php)It's been around for a bit, but I figured I should post about a little side project I've been working on. As a physicist, I spend a lot of time tracking down citations; and typically they are in a handful of journals. Rather than bookmarking the journal homepage or search box, I realized that reverse-engineering the search URL for each journal was pretty simple. After that, it was just a matter of wrapping a little mac [dashboard widget](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php) around them and presto: 1-click article retrieval.More details at the project page: [http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php)
