<p>Finally checked in on a <a href="http://skvidal.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/brain-thing-meme/" title="brain thing meme &laquo; journal/notes">friend's blog</a> and found an amazingly accurate <a href="http://mindmedia.com/braintest.html" title="Brainworks Left Right Brain Test">brain profiler</a>. Without further ado, my results:</p>
<p>Your Brain Usage Profile:</p>
<p>Auditory : 50%<br />
Visual : 50%<br />
Left : 47%<br />
Right : 52%</p>
<p>Full summary below the fold...</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<blockquote><p>Andy, you are one of those rare individuals who are perfectly "balanced" in both your hemispheric tendencies and your sensory learning preferences. However, there is both good news and bad news.</p>
<p>A problem with hemispheric balance is that you will tend to feel more conflict than someone who has a clearly established dominance. At times the conflict will be between what you feel and what you think but will also involve how you attack problems and how you perceive information. Details which will seem important to the right hemis-phere will be discounted by the left and vice versa, which can present a hindrance to learning efficiently.</p>
<p>In the same vein, you may have a problem with organization. You might organize your time and/or space only to feel the need to reorganize five to ten weeks later.</p>
<p>On the positive side, you bring resources to problem-solving that others may not have. You can perceive the "big picture" and the essential details simultaneously and maintain the cognitive perspective required. You possess sufficient verbal skills to translate your intuition into a form which can be understood by others while still being able to access ideas and concepts which do not lend themselves to language.</p>
<p>Your balanced nature might lead you to second-guess yourself in artistic endeavors, losing some of the fluidity, spontaneity and creativity that otherwise would be yours.</p>
<p>With your balanced sensory styles, you process data alternately, at times visually and other times auditorially. This usage of separate memories may cause you to require more time to integrate information or re-access it. When presented with situations which force purely visual or purely auditory learning, increased anxiety is likely and your learning efficiency will decrease.</p>
<p>Your greatest benefit is that you can succeed in multiple fields due to the great plasticity and flexibility you possess.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, yikes, this was only 20 questions. Had they used 50 questions they would have been able to give me the lat. and long. coordinates of my house... or tell me my social security number or something.</p>
<p>The most accurate aspects are "You might organize your time and/or space only to feel the need to reorganize five to ten weeks later" and "Your balanced nature might lead you to second-guess yourself in artistic endeavors." I definitely re-organize on a 9-10 week timescale. My desk and computer both show the signs of at least 5 different "systems" that have come and gone over the years. As for the conflict during creative endeavors, I'm sure the art profs at Whitman will tell you the same thing about me.</p>
<p>Overall I agree with this summary, and now that it's been pointed out to me, I guess I'll have to keep these things in mind when I try to "organize!" On the down side, "Your greatest benefit is that you can succeed in multiple fields" really doesn't help me choose a career path.</p>
