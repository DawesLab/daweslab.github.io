I don't know what's more surprising, that there is finally a description of how serious this problem is, or that there isn't a voice of opposition to be found. No screaming conservatives telling us it will all be fine, "just go buy another SUV and forget about it."

My question to the white house is: what good will a social security personal account do me if the country faces this kind of economic turmoil. It's a course we've been on for a while but with gay people getting married, feeding tubes getting removed, and Bush finding out there's no ["pile" of social security money](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30794-2005Apr6.html), how could we possibly worry about something that actually effects the nation.

Unless some things change in the next ten years, we may be hearing a lot of "check this out... I saw this on survivor once."
