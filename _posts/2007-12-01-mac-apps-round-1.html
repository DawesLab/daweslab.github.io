<p>Inspired by a <a href="http://metadatta.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/pc-to-mac/" title="PC to Mac &laquo; {metadatta}">recent post</a> by Sujit Datta, I decided to start a series covering my favorite Mac applications. These are generally physics-type applications but should be useful to a wide range of people in any field of science.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First off, the applications that I spend roughly 80% of my time using:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bibdesk.png" align="left" /><a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/" title="BibDesk | Home">BibDesk</a> - BibTeX management with built-in PDF storage, bibtex citation export, and many other great features. My favorites are importing citations directly from Google Scholar, proper handling of accented characters, and cite-key completion in editors such as:</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/textmate.png" align="left" /><a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate â€” The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">Textmate</a> - a Unix text editor native to the mac... if that makes sense. Textmate is a native Cocoa app, making it seamless in the Mac UI, but it treats text editing like any serious unix text editor would. Great templates, shortcuts and everything in-between. I use it to write LaTeX, C++, python, MATLAB, and just about anything that isn't in binary (including this post!). Check out the blogging bundle, easy integration with popular blog API's. Even upload and link images from within Textmate.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/datagraph.png" align="left" /><a href="http://www.visualdatatools.com/DataGraph/index.html">DataGraph</a> - a very intuitive, yet still powerful, 2D plotting package. Highly capable, and very responsive developer (Local too: Chapel Hill, NC). Features include formula-based data sets, <em>a la</em> excel, curve-fitting, and plenty of options to make plots clean, and readable.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/quicksilver.png" align="left" /><a href="http://blacktree.com/?quicksilver" title="Quiksilver">Quicksilver</a> - if you thought the command line was a fast way to get things done, then you haven't seen Quicksilver. It's a multifunction launcher with more features than I can explain now. If used well, it will shave years off your life as a computer user.</p>
