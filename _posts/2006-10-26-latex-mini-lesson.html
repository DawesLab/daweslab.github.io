<p>As part of my role in the physics computing committee, I presented a mini-lesson yesterday that introduced the LaTeX document preparation system to graduate students and other Duke community members.The emphasis was on LaTeX from the beginners perspective, including an overview of the various tools available to make it easier to learn LaTeX.<!--more-->There are many links to useful LaTeX sites now posted on the Duke Physics Computing Wiki: http://admin.cgi.phy.duke.edu/wiki/LaTexOne of the linked pages is my personal page within the physics department where you can find a PDF version of the mini-lesson. The original is produced in Keynote on the Mac although I would be happy to generate other formats if anyone is interested.http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/latex.php</p>
