Of course, I have nothing against Google Docs, I used them all the time. But, I'm also a big fan of nice typefaces, PDF files, and screen sharing... all of which are features of the tools now available via <a href="http://www.acrobat.com">acrobat.com</a>. A free service (at least for now) acrobat.com has "buzzword" for wordprocessing and document collaboration, connectnow for screensharing, PDF creation (limited to a 5-document trial period), sharing and "My files". All in all, an interesting set of features. Personally, I like being able to have documents online that use Adobe fonts.
