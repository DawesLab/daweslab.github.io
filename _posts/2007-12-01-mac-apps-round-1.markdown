Inspired by a [recent post](http://metadatta.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/pc-to-mac/) by Sujit Datta, I decided to start a series covering my favorite Mac applications. These are generally physics-type applications but should be useful to a wide range of people in any field of science.




<!-- more -->



First off, the applications that I spend roughly 80% of my time using:




![](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/icons/bibdesk.png)[BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) - BibTeX management with built-in PDF storage, bibtex citation export, and many other great features. My favorites are importing citations directly from Google Scholar, proper handling of accented characters, and cite-key completion in editors such as:





![](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/icons/textmate.png)[Textmate](http://macromates.com/) - a Unix text editor native to the mac... if that makes sense. Textmate is a native Cocoa app, making it seamless in the Mac UI, but it treats text editing like any serious unix text editor would. Great templates, shortcuts and everything in-between. I use it to write LaTeX, C++, python, MATLAB, and just about anything that isn't in binary (including this post!). Check out the blogging bundle, easy integration with popular blog API's. Even upload and link images from within Textmate.





![](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/icons/datagraph.png)[DataGraph](http://www.visualdatatools.com/DataGraph/index.html) - a very intuitive, yet still powerful, 2D plotting package. Highly capable, and very responsive developer (Local too: Chapel Hill, NC). Features include formula-based data sets, _a la_ excel, curve-fitting, and plenty of options to make plots clean, and readable.





![](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/icons/quicksilver.png)[Quicksilver](http://blacktree.com/?quicksilver) - if you thought the command line was a fast way to get things done, then you haven't seen Quicksilver. It's a multifunction launcher with more features than I can explain now. If used well, it will shave years off your life as a computer user.
