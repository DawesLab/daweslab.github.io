As a physicist, I spend a lot of time tracking down citations; and typically they are in a handful of journals. Rather than bookmarking the journal homepage or search box, I realized that reverse-engineering the search URL for each journal was pretty simple. After that, it was just a matter of wrapping a little mac <a href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php">dashboard widget</a> around them and presto: 1-click article retrieval.More details at the project page: <a href="http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php">http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/computing/articlewidget.php</a></p>
