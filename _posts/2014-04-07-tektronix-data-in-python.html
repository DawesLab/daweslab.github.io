<p>In the Photonics and Quantum Optics lab, I've made open-source a high priority. With that in mind, we've written software to interface with many of our instruments. We also rely on <a href="http://github.com/DawesLab">github</a> for version control and dissemination of our code. I'm particularly happy with a small application that pulls data from a Tektronix oscilloscope (tested on TDS1000 &amp; 2000 models). This is my first python GUI app, despite having worked in python quite heavily for the past 12+ years. If you are interested, the work-in-progress code is <a href="http://github.com/DawesLab/instruments">available</a> and should work for a Tek scope plugged in to USB on a linux host. I can't promise it works on other platforms.</p>
<p>Here is a partial list of the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>wxPython</li>
<li>python-usbtmc</li>
</ul>
<p>All but the last are fairly standard for scientific use of python. The last can be installed by your package manager. In Fedora, run</p>
<pre>yum install python-matplotlib-wx</pre>
<p>and that should ensure that you have all but the last of these components installed. I used the python package manager "pip" to install the usbtmc package:</p>
<pre>pip install python-usbtmc</pre>
<p>Credit for this project also goes to Eli Bendersky for an awesome <a href="http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/08/01/matplotlib-with-wxpython-guis/">example</a> that got me 90% through this process.</p>
