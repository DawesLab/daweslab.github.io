<p>Well it's been a while, hopefully I have a good excuse. Leslie and I welcomed our son Carter into the world on Jan 17th at 5:02 am and we've been settling in to parenthood very well. The little moments are so amazing, even the early-morning ones! It truely is an amazing experience. We have updates and photos at <a href="http://andyandleslie.blogspot.com">our blog</a> so feel free to check those out. I'll have more to say here again before long.</p>
