<p>I have finally reunited my 1988 IBM model M keyboard with my primary computer. Currently, my desktop is an 8-core mac pro. I'm sure the keyboard has never had so much power at its disposal. It took some <a title="PS/2 to USB Adapter" href="http://www.clickykeyboards.com/index.cfm/fa/items.main/parentcat/11298/subcatid/0/id/124184">adapting</a>, and key re-mapping, but I'm typing this post to the classic cadence of buckling springs. "It's so choice, if you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up."</p>
<p><!--more-->For anyone that is interested, the basic key re-mapping can be done in the mac system preferences. Under "Keyboard" there is a "Modifier Keys..." button that allows you to reassign the control, command, option, and caps lock keys. I've set up the following map:</p>
<p>Caps Lock key is "control"</p>
<p>Alt key is "command"</p>
<p>Control key is "option"</p>
<p>Command key is "caps lock"</p>
<p>Note: since the IBM Model M does not have a command key I've effectively thrown out "caps lock." But honestly, aside from <a title="don't use all caps" href="http://email.about.com/od/netiquettetips/qt/Writing-In-All-Caps-Is-Like-Shouting.htm">email screamers</a>, who uses caps lock?</p>
<p>I have also downloaded <a title="double command software" href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/">DoubleCommand</a> which offers more powerful key re-mapping. If it is dramatically better, I'll post a note about it here.</p>
