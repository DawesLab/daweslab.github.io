<p>I have had some success with converting my MATLAB code to C++. There are some caveats, from array indexing (minor), to missing functions (less trivial to fix). In case people are looking for solutions to these problems, I've posted some sample code.</p>
<p>To motivate the conversion a little bit more, my code spends 99% of its time computing FFTs. I initially found that FFT benchmarks in MATLAB were comparable to C++, which can be explained by the fact that MATLAB calls FFTW libraries which are well optimized. However, I wasn't using a well-optimized array implementation so the real improvement came when I found John Bowman's <a href="http://www.math.ualberta.ca/~bowman/Array" title="fftw++ and Array.h">fftw++ headers and Array class</a>. In the end, re-writing my code with these data structures results in a 2-4x speedup over MATLAB. The additional advantage is that a portion of my simulation is embarrassingly parallel so C++ makes it easy to exploit that.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Now, on to the tips and tricks. Re-indexing arrays is a simple matter, just remember MATLAB is 1 to N and C++ is 0 to N-1 for arrays of N elements. You'll get used to nested <em>for</em> loops, and the code isn't as compact as MATLAB's <code>array1(:,:) = 5*array2(:,:,5)</code> etc, but just match your index and you're set.</p>
<p>I was sorely missing the fftshift function but came up with the following workaround. More background: I have an operator, called expDz, that has to be applied in Fourier space. I can easily compute it in regular coordinates but the Fast Fourier Transform works in a shifted space where the DC component is the first element, and the N/2...N components are the negative frequencies. One dimensional arrays are pretty trivial to deal with, but when you're working with spatial transforms on 2D data, these ideas aren't as intuitive. What I did to get expDz to be properly aligned in Fourier space is the following in MATLAB:</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre>
  grid = (-N/2:N/2-1); % set up the numerical grid
  xstep = 6*w0/N; % spatial frequency in x
  ystep = xstep;
  Kxstep=2*pi/(N*xstep); % spatial K-vector steps
  Kystep=2*pi/(N*ystep);
  [kx ky]=meshgrid(fftshift(Kxstep*grid),fftshift(Kystep*grid)); 
  % shift everyone to build the meshgrid in Fourier space.
  theta_n = zstep/(2*sigma).*(kx.^2+ky.^2); 
  % arg to be put in Exp function
  exp_Dz = exp(-i*theta_n); % it's a one-liner
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>Which in C++ becomes:</p>
<p><code></p>
<pre>
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++){
  for (j = 0; j &lt; N; j++){
    if (i &lt; N/2 &amp;&amp; j &lt; N/2){
      expDz(i,j) = exp(-I*(zstep/(2*sigma)*(((i)*kxstep*(i)*kxstep) 
                       + ((j)*kystep*(j)*kystep))));
    } else if (i &lt; N/2 &amp;&amp; j &gt;= N/2){
      expDz(i,j) = exp(-I*(zstep/(2*sigma)*(((i)*kxstep*(i)*kxstep) 
                       + ((j-N)*kystep*(j-N)*kystep))));
    } else if (i &gt;= N/2 &amp;&amp; j &lt; N/2){
      expDz(i,j) = exp(-I*(zstep/(2*sigma)*(((i-N)*kxstep*(i-N)*kxstep) 
                       + ((j)*kystep*(j)*kystep))));
    } else if (i &gt;= N/2 &amp;&amp; j &gt;= N/2){
      expDz(i,j) = exp(-I*(zstep/(2*sigma)*(((i-N)*kxstep*(i-N)*kxstep) 
                       + ((j-N)*kystep*(j-N)*kystep))));
    } else {
      cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: could not properly determine the propagator" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p></code></p>
<p>In short, I just calculate each quadrant of expDz individually by wrapping one or both index by N.The algorithm being used here is the split-step beam propagation method, which explains the need for doing math in the fourier domain. In general this approach works as a replacement for fftshift, and I plan to write a small header file with a C function that performs this.</p>
