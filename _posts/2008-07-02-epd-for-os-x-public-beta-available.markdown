My knack for checking for software releases on the release day shines again today. Several months ago I had heard a rumor about the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) being developed for the Mac. Between writing my dissertation and packing up my family for our upcoming move, I hadn't thought about it again... until today. And of course, today [this](http://blog.enthought.com/?p=43) announcement was posted. So I'm currently pulling down a 200 MB installer package and I'll post again soon once I have a chance to tinker.
