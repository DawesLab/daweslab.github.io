<p>Well it seems fairly telling to look over the list of people with whom I share a birthday. I have chosen two that are particularly appropriate to my field of research, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born">Max Born</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster">Sir David Brewster</a>. Dealing with quantum optics we take a lot from Max Born and our laser certainly wouldn't work without it's Brewster plates.</p>
