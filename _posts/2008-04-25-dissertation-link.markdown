It's finally done. I submitted the final version of my [dissertation](http://www.phy.duke.edu/~dawes/Dawes_duplex.pdf)[PDF] to the Graduate School. Naturally, that means I'll be headed to the beach tomorrow for a weekend of camping in the sand.




Not that I expect anyone to, but you're welcome to read it, just as long as you don't tell me about any typos... at least not until next week sometime :-)
