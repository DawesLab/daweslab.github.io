[![](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/p1010099_preview_card.jpg?w=300)](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25902)We've been using the Dichroic Atomic Vapor Laser Lock (DAVLL) system for laser stabilization in our lab. After getting tired of our first version of a solenoid coil, I turned my summer students loose designing a new one. Not only is the version vastly better, but it's made in-house on our own 3D printer.

I'm proud to say it was recently featured on [Thingiverse](www.thingiverse.com)Â as thing [25902](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25902). Way to go Noah!

If you want to hack on it, the original is available [on tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com/things/6XzdNRMyl5A).
