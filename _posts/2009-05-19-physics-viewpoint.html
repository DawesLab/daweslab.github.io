<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/thumb_e1.png" alt="atoms in hollow fiber" title="atoms in hollow fiber" width="125" height="125" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-219" />Take a look at <a title="Physics" href="http://physics.aps.org">physics.aps.org</a> for my <a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/41">Viewpoint</a> article on <a href="http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.203902">Efficient All-Optical Switching Using Slow Light within a Hollow Fiber</a> by Bajcsy et al. The work demonstrates an all-optical switch that was built by inserting cold Rubidium atoms into the hollow core of a photonic-crystal fiber. These fibers have been used in a wide range of nonlinear optics experiments and this is yet another interesting application.</p>
