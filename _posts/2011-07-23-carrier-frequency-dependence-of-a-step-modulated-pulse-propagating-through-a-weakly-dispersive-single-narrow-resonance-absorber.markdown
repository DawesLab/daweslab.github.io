Our article on optical precursors is out now, visit the abstract at:

[Carrier-frequency dependence of a step-modulated pulse propagating through a weakly dispersive single narrow-resonance absorber](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500340.2011.575961)

Near a narrow resonance, an optical pulse can pass through a strongly-absorbing atomic vapor for the first few nanoseconds. The part of the pulse that makes it through the material is called a precursor. Our paper explores the form of the precursors as the carrier frequency is tuned off resonance.
