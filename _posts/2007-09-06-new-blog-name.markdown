A quick google blog search revealed I was nowhere near as clever as I thought for naming this blog _clevertitlehere_. To remedy this I've elected to call this publication _The Daily Photon_. Being a physicist I just had to use up an [envelope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation) for some quick math. _The Daily Photon_ implies one photon every 24 hours (yes those photons work around the clock!). This [corresponds](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&q=2+ev+per+day+in+watts&btnG=Search) to less than 4 yoctowatts or


$latex 4\times10^{-24}~\mathrm{Watts}$


Now, I have no pretensions of publishing a powerful blog but I really had no idea it would be this weak.

As a side note, if you're curious how I got $latex \LaTeX&s=-1$ into my wordpress blog, then check out [Math for the Masses](http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/02/17/math-for-the-masses/). I'm proud to say I actually went to high school with the guy who added this feature to wordpress, rock on mdawaffe!
