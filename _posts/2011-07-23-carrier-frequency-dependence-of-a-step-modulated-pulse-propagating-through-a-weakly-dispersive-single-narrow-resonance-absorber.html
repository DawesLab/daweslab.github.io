<p>Near a narrow resonance, an optical pulse can pass through a strongly-absorbing atomic vapor for the first few nanoseconds. The part of the pulse that makes it through the material is called a precursor. Our paper explores the form of the precursors as the carrier frequency is tuned off resonance.</p>
