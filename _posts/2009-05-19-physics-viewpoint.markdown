![atoms in hollow fiber](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/thumb_e1.png)Take a look at [physics.aps.org](http://physics.aps.org) for my [Viewpoint](http://physics.aps.org/articles/v2/41) article on [Efficient All-Optical Switching Using Slow Light within a Hollow Fiber](http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.203902) by Bajcsy et al. The work demonstrates an all-optical switch that was built by inserting cold Rubidium atoms into the hollow core of a photonic-crystal fiber. These fibers have been used in a wide range of nonlinear optics experiments and this is yet another interesting application.
