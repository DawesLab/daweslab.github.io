<p>An interesting post about recent work on the implementation of python-based modeling in physics courses. Read more at <a title="What students get wrong (python in physics courses)" href="http://computinged.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/what-students-get-wrong-when-building-computational-physics-models-in-python-cabellero-thesis-part-2/">Mark Guzdial's blog.</a></p>
<p>The post is part 2 of 3 that summarize some wonderful points in Marcos Daniel “Danny” Caballero's PhD thesis at Georgia Tech. Danny is the first Physics Education Research (PER) student from GT.</p>
<p>I am interested in the possibility of catching some common exceptions and using python features to replace boring error messages with something that speaks to the underlying physics. I doubt this could be done on a general level, but perhaps it could be done for certain types of problems, and included invisibly by the instructor. I need to brush up on how to catch exceptions in python, but I'd like to hear from anyone who is familiar with python exceptions.</p>
