[![The National Science Foundation (NSF)](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/nsf1.jpeg)](http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/nsf1.jpeg)I'm pleased to announce that my research group has been awarded an NSF RUI grant to support our research. The RUI (research at undergraduate institutions) program specifies resources for scientific research at colleges like Pacific. I feel very fortunate to be able to offer summer research opportunities to undergraduates for at least the next three years. I will be posting more details about the project shortly, but at the moment I am getting ready to order some new instruments and equipment so we can hit the ground running.

On a more personal note, I'm happy to share space in the NSF Award search results with my Mom: her award is for science outreach in the Moscow-Pullman area of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho:
