<p>What started as a pretty informal online chat about an old riddle has led to several risky video-experiments and an even shakier theoretical analysis. I find the discussion to be a good example of how physics tends to be more about choosing your simplifying assumptions than about answering real-world questions. It's also good for a peek at the ways theorists and experimentalists approach any given problem.<a href="http://rulesoflunch.wordpress.com/2007/08/31/juggling-off-the-weight/" title="Juggling off the weight">Juggling off the Weight</a></p>
