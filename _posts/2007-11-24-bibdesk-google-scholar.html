<p><a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/bibdesk/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bibdeskicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" alt="BibDesk.app" /></a>There is a lot to like about the <a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net">BibDesk</a> citation manager. First off, it works with BibTeX (in fact it's file structure <em>is</em> BibTeX). There have been a lot of reviews, most of them positive of course... what's not to like about open-source native cocoa applications that "do the right thing"? I wanted to post here, just in case readers haven't seen it or heard about it, but also to highlight one of the coolest new features in the latest version: automagic citation retrieval from the web.<!--more-->I use Google Scholar quite a bit, for one, I like the Google attitude toward user interfaces. But beyond that, I like that it just works, and it gives a link to BibTeX and your local library (both features can be set in the preferences). So when I noticed that BibDesk can view Google scholar results and automatically parse the BibTeX links, I was hooked. See the following screenshot for a demo:<a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/picture-1.png" title="bibdesk google scholar"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/picture-1.png" alt="bibdesk google scholar" /></a>Open a Google Scholar search in BibDesk, and in the pane right below it are all the BibTeX links with easy iTunes-style "import" buttons right there ready to populate your BibTeX database. Writing articles in LaTeX has never been an easy process, but I find that between BibDesk and BibTeX, it's much improved. Now I just need a system to keep my printed papers sorted and organized...</p>
