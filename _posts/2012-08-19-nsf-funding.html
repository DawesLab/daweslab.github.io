The RUI (research at undergraduate institutions) program specifies resources for scientific research at colleges like Pacific. I feel very fortunate to be able to offer summer research opportunities to undergraduates for at least the next three years. I will be posting more details about the project shortly, but at the moment I am getting ready to order some new instruments and equipment so we can hit the ground running.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, I'm happy to share space in the NSF Award search results with my Mom: her award is for science outreach in the Moscow-Pullman area of Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho:</p>
