Well it's been a while, hopefully I have a good excuse. Leslie and I welcomed our son Carter into the world on Jan 17th at 5:02 am and we've been settling in to parenthood very well. The little moments are so amazing, even the early-morning ones! It truely is an amazing experience. We have updates and photos at [our blog](http://andyandleslie.blogspot.com) so feel free to check those out. I'll have more to say here again before long.
