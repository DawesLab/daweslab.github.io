<p>A quick google blog search revealed I was nowhere near as clever as I thought for naming this blog <em>clevertitlehere</em>. To remedy this I've elected to call this publication <em>The Daily Photon</em>. Being a physicist I just had to use up an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation" title="Back-of-the-envelope calculation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">envelope</a> for some quick math. <em>The Daily Photon</em> implies one photon every 24 hours (yes those photons work around the clock!). This <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=2+ev+per+day+in+watts&amp;btnG=Search" title="Google">corresponds</a> to less than 4 yoctowatts or</p>
<p align="center">$latex 4\times10^{-24}~\mathrm{Watts}$</p>
<p>Now, I have no pretensions of publishing a powerful blog but I really had no idea it would be this weak.<br />

As a side note, if you're curious how I got $latex \LaTeX&amp;s=-1$ into my wordpress blog, then check out <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/02/17/math-for-the-masses/" title="Math for the Masses Â« WordPress.com">Math for the Masses</a>. I'm proud to say I actually went to high school with the guy who added this feature to wordpress, rock on mdawaffe!</p>
