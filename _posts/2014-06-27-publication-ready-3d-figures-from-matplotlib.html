<p><a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-27-at-9-23-25-am.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-850" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2014-06-27-at-9-23-25-am.png?w=143" alt="Screen Shot 2014-06-27 at 9.23.25 AM" width="210" height="220" /></a>I'm a big fan of scripting my plot creation. I also use python for all of my data acquisition and analysis. This naturally put me in a spot to dive into matplotlib when it came time to create figures for a paper I'm working on. It took a bit of digging, but I worked through the kinks and put together a 3D surface plot (with contours) that is PDF and publication ready. I addressed the several issues by overriding the defaults. I want to clarify that I like the defaults for on-screen display, presentations, and posters, but they weren't quite right for a tiny two-pane figure in a two-column manuscript. Things I "fixed" include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many ticks and labels</li>
<li>Small fonts (when reduced to publication dimensions)</li>
<li>Tick labels misaligned relative to ticks (problem seems to come from using larger fonts to fix the previous issue)</li>
<li>Odd axes label alignment, rotation, and placement</li>
<li>Busy background (removed the gray panes with gridlines)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the solutions were easy, some are hackish and only one uses the lightly-documented <a href="http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Axes3d-have-improved-handling-of-label-placement-yet-td41498.html">_axinfo</a> dict. I'll highlight a few snippets that were useful in this process (full code linked below).<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>Fontsize</h2>
<p>To adjust the font sizes, I took the rc approach which modifies the global settings (at least within this script). The following three lines take care of the font style/size issues:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]rc('font',size=28)<br />
rc('font',family='serif')<br />
rc('axes',labelsize=32)[/code]</p>
<p>Notice that this requires the use of <tt style="color:#0000ff;">from matplotlib import rc</tt>.<br />
I didn't like the spacing between the tick labels and the axes so I use the following six lines to loop through the tick labels and set their alignment parameters:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
[t.set_va('center') for t in ax1.get_yticklabels()]<br />
[t.set_ha('left') for t in ax1.get_yticklabels()]<br />
[t.set_va('center') for t in ax1.get_xticklabels()]<br />
[t.set_ha('right') for t in ax1.get_xticklabels()]<br />
[t.set_va('center') for t in ax1.get_zticklabels()]<br />
[t.set_ha('left') for t in ax1.get_zticklabels()]<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Where <tt>.set_va</tt> is a method to set the vertical alignment, and <tt>.set_ha</tt> sets the horizontal alignment. Notice that the alignment choice depends on the axis in order to get the label close to the axis.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>To clear out the grid, remove the gray fill and outline the panes (i.e. create an empty cubic wireframe around the plot) I use the following:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
ax1.grid(False)<br />
ax1.xaxis.pane.set_edgecolor('black')<br />
ax1.yaxis.pane.set_edgecolor('black')<br />
ax1.xaxis.pane.fill = False<br />
ax1.yaxis.pane.fill = False<br />
ax1.zaxis.pane.fill = False<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>A final note of caution, in my testing, I found that the visibility of parts of the pane edge depends on the viewing angle. I found that setting the view to <tt>ax1.view_init(elev=10, azim=135)</tt> worked to see all the edge lines. Notice that this does put the x and y axes in a counter-intuitive orientation. For my purposes, those directions are arbitrary, but that may not always be the case.</p>
<h2>Tick placement</h2>
<p>There are two things I changed about the ticks, first, the way they point and how long they are. I like ticks pointing into the plot that leave a clean edge around the boundary. To achieve this I did have to dive into the realm of <tt>_axinfo</tt> (here be dragons):</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
ax1.xaxis._axinfo['tick']['inward_factor'] = 0<br />
ax1.xaxis._axinfo['tick']['outward_factor'] = 0.4<br />
ax1.yaxis._axinfo['tick']['inward_factor'] = 0<br />
ax1.yaxis._axinfo['tick']['outward_factor'] = 0.4<br />
ax1.zaxis._axinfo['tick']['inward_factor'] = 0<br />
ax1.zaxis._axinfo['tick']['outward_factor'] = 0.4<br />
ax1.zaxis._axinfo['tick']['outward_factor'] = 0.4<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Notice the order isn't what I'd expect: I had to set the inward factor to zero and increase the outward factor. This may be a bug so don't count on it to always work (and don't count on access to <tt>_axinfo</tt> at all for that matter).</p>
<p>The final change to the ticks was to use a different tick placement. Matplotlib has several to choose from and I wanted to select an even interval so the <tt>MultipleLocator</tt> ticker is my tool. Load it with <tt style="color:#0000ff;">from matplotlib.ticker import MultipleLocator</tt> and then implement for all three axes as follows:</p>
<p>[code language="python"]<br />
ax1.xaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(5))<br />
ax1.yaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(5))<br />
ax1.zaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(0.01))<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This is not automagic so you'd have to change the base interval (or make it programmatic) if you want a general-purpose figure script. I personally have some quick and dirty figure-making scripts (using mostly defaults) for analyzing my own data and then I write up a specific script to create a specific plot for the manuscript. Much of those scripts get heavily reused, but this was the first time I had to create a 3D surface plot and also the farthest I've had to dig into matplotlib. I figured I'd document it for that reason. Good luck, and I hope you find this helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ben Root for the tip on setting the pane edgecolor... that piece took me the longest to work out.</p>
