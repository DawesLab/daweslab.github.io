This is my introductory blog created via TextMate mostly as an exercise in configuration. I'll keep this site up to date with the fun things I discover... as I discover them. In the meantime, I'll be learning TextMate since it has already found it's way into just about all of my workflows (and the 30-day trial hasn't even expired yet!). Previous posts have been imported from a blog I kept at blogspot.com. This will be my only blog, I promise.
