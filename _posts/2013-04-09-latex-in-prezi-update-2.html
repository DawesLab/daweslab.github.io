<p>It has been a few years since my initial post about <a title="LaTeX inÂ Prezi" href="http://dawes.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/latex-in-prezi/">LaTeX in prezi</a>. In that time, the <a title="Prezi" href="http://www.prezi.com">Prezi</a> interface has been updated quite a bit. I did want to let everyone know that the hack I have been using still works, even though things look quite different. To clarify, there is a great Latex-to-image generator available that enables this hack. Specifically, type your latex code after the "?" character in the following URL and you will get an SWF image containing the rendered latex:</p>
<pre>http://latex.codecogs.com/swf.latex?1+sin(x)</pre>
<p>The way to use this in Prezi is to paste the URL into an image search. It seems like this wouldn't work because the image sounds like a search box... but don't worry, it will.</p>
<p>First, select Insert Image...</p>
<p><a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-14-13-pm.png"><a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-12-50-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-716" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 6.12.50 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-12-50-pm.png?w=300" width="300" height="97" /></a></a></p>
<p>Then type in your URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-14-13-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-714" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 6.14.13 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-14-13-pm.png?w=300" width="300" height="108" /></a>And it will return with the rendered LaTeX:</p>
<p><a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-14-28-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-712" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-08 at 6.14.28 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2013-04-08-at-6-14-28-pm.png?w=300" width="300" height="112" /></a>It really is that easy. Of course, if you don't know LaTeX very well, there is always the <a title="CodeCogs Equation Editor" href="http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php">CodeCogs online equation editor</a>. And for the record, this whole thing is powered by Code Cogs, so if you use it, please consider making at least a small donation.</p>
