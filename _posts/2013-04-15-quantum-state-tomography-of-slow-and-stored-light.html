<p>[slideshare id=17863016&amp;doc=reedseminar2013-130329103603-phpapp02]</p>
<p>As I continue to experiment with open-access science, I plan to post my slides here for anyone who is interested. This talk is a Seminar I gave at Reed College; it is based on a shorter talk written for Photonics West 2013.</p>
