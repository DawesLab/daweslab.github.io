Just some tips I discovered for using the Finder in Mac OS X. The folder icon in the top acts like the folder icon would before it was opened... i.e. dragging it to a new location will move (or copy) the folder to the new location. Even better: option-click on the title of the finder window and you get a file tree to browse up. All the features of _other_ file browsers but without the extra space being used in the menu bar!
