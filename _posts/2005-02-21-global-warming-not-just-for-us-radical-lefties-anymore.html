<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1489955,00.html">Times Online - World</a>: "'The debate about whether there is a global warming signal now is over, at least for rational people,'"</p>
<p>I don't mean to be on a tear about global warming (it's no shock to me) but as long as people are finally paying attention, I'll do my part to keep it on the radar.</p>
<p>Now if only we had some rational people around to run the country...</p>
