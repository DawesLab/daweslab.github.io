<p>I've made my last revisions prior to handing my dissertation over to my committee members tomorrow (ok, technically that's just later today). My defense is scheduled for 9am on April 11th so I've got just over a week to put together my presentation. After writing 160 pages on my research, I think 20 slides will be straightforward. And no, I won't just put 8 pages of information on each slide, that would be science-talk suicide.</p>
