Well it seems fairly telling to look over the list of people with whom I share a birthday. I have chosen two that are particularly appropriate to my field of research, [Max Born](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born) and [Sir David Brewster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brewster). Dealing with quantum optics we take a lot from Max Born and our laser certainly wouldn't work without it's Brewster plates.
