<p>I've been tinkering with it for a while, but I am finally sitting down to write about <a title="QuTiP" href="https://code.google.com/p/qutip/">QuTiP</a>, a great toolbox for doing quantum mechanics in the Python computing language. A couple things came together recently to re-ignite my interest and get me to think about QuTiP again. First was an email and later <a title="QuTiP on Picloud" href="http://qutip.blogspot.com/2013/04/getting-started-with-qutip-on-picloud.html">blog post</a>Â by Markus Baden about how to set up QuTiP on picloud. The second was the discovery of picloud itself. Last week I was finally starting to dive in to a project to wire up five servers into a mini-cluster and then this week I learn about massively scalable computing in the cloud for mere pennies (<a title="picloud" href="http://www.picloud.com">picloud.com</a>).<a href="http://dawes.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/logo.png"><br />

I estimate that keeping them on all year will cost about $800 in electricity (not including the AC to cool them). For that I can have 16,000 core hours of computing power per year. My cluster would only have 20 cores total so I would have to run a full month of computing jobs (800 hours = 33 days). Picloud is such an obvious win that I don't even have to factor in the time I would spend maintaining my own cluster.</p>
