excerpt: 'Experimentally obtained transient transmission intensity (black solid lines)
  compared with two theoretical anal- ysis: the asymptotic analysis (Eqs. (8)-(9)
  and Eq. (10), red dotted lines), and the weakly dispersive narrow resonance (Eqs.
  (13)-(17) and Eq. (17), blue dashed lines). Transient transmission taken near the
  4S1/2 (F = 1) ↔ 4P1/2 (F = 2) transition for (a) ∆ = ∆(1) ∼ 5δ, (b) ∆ = ∆(2) ∼ δ,
  and (c) ∆ = ∆(3) ∼ 0.'
